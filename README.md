# Studious Enigma - Note Taker Application

## Description

The Studious Enigma Note Taker application is designed to help users write, save, and organize notes effectively. Motivated by the need to streamline note-taking and task organization, this project provides a user-friendly interface for users to create and manage notes seamlessly. The application addresses the challenge of managing tasks and ideas, providing a digital solution for keeping track of important information. Throughout the development process, I learned valuable skills in building a full-stack application, integrating front-end and back-end components, and deploying a functional web application to Heroku.
